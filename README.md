- Cursor tracking: See each user's cursor position within the code editor for better collaboration.
- Username display: Easily identify who is making changes during the session.

### Coding Playgrounds

Hacker-Hire offers a diverse range of coding playgrounds tailored to different frameworks and languages, including:

- Vanilla (plain JavaScript)
- React
- Next.js
- Vue.js
- Angular
- Vite
- Node.js
- TypeScript

### Advanced Coding Experience

- **Monaco Editor**: Enjoy a rich coding experience with syntax highlighting, code folding, and intelligent code completion.
- **Firepad-X**: Real-time collaborative editing within the web application.
- **SandPack**: Run and preview code within the browser during the interview process.

Sure, I've added the following step to the "Getting Started" section in the README file:

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hacker-hire.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd hacker-hire-client
npm install
```

3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and provide the required Firebase environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

This step will remind users to rename the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and provide the necessary Firebase environment variables required for the application to function correctly.
